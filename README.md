# Statistical Analysis and Optimization Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze a dataset by applying statistical methods and optimization techniques. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis, data preparation, model building, and evaluation. We build models (e.g., multiple linear regression or time series models) and interpret the results, ensuring model robustness through diagnostics and performance evaluation.

## Objectives
- Conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis to understand data distribution and variable relationships.
- Prepare data for modeling, ensuring data quality and suitability.
- Build a predictive model and justify all steps in the modeling process.
- Interpret the final model’s coefficients, statistical significance, and predictive power.
- Diagnose the model to ensure it meets statistical assumptions.
- Evaluate the model’s predictive capabilities using a test dataset.

## Project Structure

- **Introduction**: Overview of the analysis objectives.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Analyze levels of measurement and descriptive statistics for all variables.
  - Provide visualizations that offer insights into data distributions and relationships.
- **Data Preparation**:
  - Describe and justify each data preparation step, including handling missing data and outliers.
  - Outline any transformations applied to variables.
- **Modelling**:
  - Detail the modeling process, including rationale for model selection and rejection of intermediate models.
  - Describe handling of missing data, outliers, and transformations for final model variables.
- **Interpretation**:
  - For multiple linear regression models: Interpret coefficients, p-values, and confidence intervals.
  - For time series models: Interpret model parameters and their significance.
- **Diagnostics**:
  - Assess if the final model meets the Gauss-Markov assumptions (for regression models).
  - Use visualizations and statistical tests for model diagnostics.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Evaluate model performance on a test dataset to assess predictive capability.
